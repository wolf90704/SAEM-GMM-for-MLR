# SAEM-GMM-for-MLR

This repository contains MATLAB code for implementing the Stochastic Approximation Expectation-Maximization with Gaussian Mixture Model (SAEM-GMM) algorithm, applied to Multiclass Logistic Regression with Missing Gaussian Mixture Covariates.

## Features
- **SAEM-GMM Algorithm**: Implementation of the SAEM algorithm tailored for logistic regression with missing data modeled as a Gaussian mixture.
- **Imputation Methods**: Comparisons of various imputation techniques including:
  - Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE)
  - MissForest
  - Mean Imputation
  - Multiple EM
  - Conditional Mean Imputation

## Requirements
- MATLAB (Version 2021a or later recommended)
