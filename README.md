SAEM-GMM-for-MLR

This repository contains MATLAB code for implementing the Stochastic Approximation Expectation-Maximization with Gaussian Mixture Model (SAEM-GMM) algorithm, applied to Multiclass Logistic Regression with Missing Gaussian Mixture Covariates.
Features

    SAEM-GMM Algorithm: Implementation of the SAEM algorithm tailored for logistic regression with missing data modeled as a Gaussian mixture.
    Imputation Methods: Comparisons of various imputation techniques including:
        Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE)
        MissForest
        Mean Imputation
        Multiple EM
        Conditional Mean Imputation

Requirements

    MATLAB (Version 2021a or later recommended)

Running the Code

To test the different algorithms and the SAEM-GMM implementation, you can execute the main_SAEM_GMM.m file. This script is designed to run the various algorithms and compare their performance.
